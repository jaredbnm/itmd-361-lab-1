  <h1>ITMD-361 Lab 1 Assignment</h1>
  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>My name is Jared Benman and I am currently a second year student studying ITM. Some of my hobbies include gaming, reading, fashion, language learning, and I also just started learning how to 
    play the guitar! For my future career goals, I plan to work towards becoming an UI/UX designer. I am very excited to learn web development in this class as it's very intruiging to me and will 
    definately help me in the future.</p>
